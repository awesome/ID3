# ID3
native Ruby ID3 tag library, which does not depend on architecture-dependent C-libraries. 
It supports reading and writing ID3-tag versions 1.0, 1.1, and 2.2.x, 2,3.x, 2,4.x

Initial release was 12 Oct 2002

The library uses Metaprogramming at it's core - see ./lib/id3/frame.rb

# NOTE
the latest version on the trunk is version 1.0.0_pre4 , a pre-release which aims at Ruby 1.9 compatibility.

Due to a RubyGems.org hickup I currently can not push the pre4 release as a Gem, but will do so soon.
